# Coursework
Projects and Coursework completed as a Computer Science Undergraduate in National University of Singapore. Also contains notes and summarised cheatsheets for various modules I've taken throughut my time in NUS Computer Science course found under the `Notes` and `Cheatsheets` directories.<br />
<br />
Module Coursework: <br />
**CS2030 Programming Methodology II** <br />
Simulator - Program that briefly simulates the behaviour of a shop and customers during different situations. <br />
InfiniteList - Program that applies functional aspect of Java (Functions, Suppliers, etc) to create an infinitely generated list of integers<br />
MatrixMultiplication - Program that uses asynchronous programming to multiply 2 matrices of up to size 2^11 (Uses ForkJoinPool to execute asynchronous tasks) <br />
BusSG Web API - Program that uses asynchronous programming to speed up retrieval of data on various Buses (e.g Bus routes, bus stops) (Uses CompletableFuture for asynchronous tasks) <br />
<br/>
**CS2105 Introduction to Computer Networks** <br/>
Assignment 1: WebServer.py - Program that allows transfer of files and data through the use of basic socket programming. Uses the socket library from Python <br/>
Assignment 2: ReliableUDPSender.py - Program that runs over the unreliable UDP, and implements reliable data delivery using reliable data transfer(RDT) protocols and Go-Back-N pipelined delivery. <br/>
Assignment 3:  Alice.py/Amy.py - Program that emulates network security by encrypting data for sending to receiver using public key and symmetric key cryptography, digital signatures and hashing algorithms. Uses PyCrypto modules from Python <br/>
