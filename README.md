# Coursework
Projects and Coursework completed as a Computer Science Undergraduate in National University of Singapore. Also contains notes and summarised cheatsheets for various modules I've taken throughut my time in NUS Computer Science course found under the `Notes` and `Cheatsheets` directories.<br />
<br />

**Source Code:**<br>
- CS2030: Programming Methodology 2
  - Simulator - Program that briefly simulates the behaviour of a shop and customers during different situations.
  - InfiniteList - Program that applies functional aspect of Java (Functions, Suppliers, etc) to create an infinitely generated list of integers<br>
  - MatrixMultiplication - Program that uses asynchronous programming to multiply 2 matrices of up to size 2^11 (Uses  ForkJoinPool to execute asynchronous tasks)<br>
  - BusSG Web API - Program that uses asynchronous programming to speed up retrieval of data on various Buses (e.g Bus routes, bus stops) (Uses CompletableFuture for asynchronous tasks) <br>
  
- CS2105: Computer Networks
  - Assignment 1: WebServer.py - Program that allows transfer of files and data through the use of basic socket programming. Uses the socket library from Python
  - Assignment 2: ReliableUDPSender.py - Program that runs over the unreliable UDP, and implements reliable data delivery using reliable data transfer(RDT) protocols and Go-Back-N pipelined delivery.
  - Assignment 3: Alice.py/Amy.py - Program that emulates network security by encrypting data for sending to receiver using public key and symmetric key cryptography, digital signatures and hashing algorithms. Uses PyCrypto modules from Python
